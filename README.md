## üß∞ Team Tools
For the implementation of the practice, we have coordinated our tasks using [Jira](https://daw-equipo10-23-24.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DAW10/boards/1).

To coordinate the implementation of the code and be able to work on it separately, we have used [github](https://github.com/CodeURJC-DAW-2023-24/webapp10).
