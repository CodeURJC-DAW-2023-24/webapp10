  ## Phase 2 MEMBERS' PARTICIPATION
  - **Vicente Navarro Raboso**:
    In this phase I made the load more function, to display more than nine events in the bets page. I also created the singup functions to allow the user to register in the app and store their information in the data base. I made the logout function and I fixed the login that had a few errors and didn't work. I make the admin page to allow the admin to add new events where the users can make their bets. Finally I make the mustache template to show the information of the events and I added the controllers to show the templates using spring.
